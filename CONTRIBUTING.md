  - OS, platform, and version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> Please do not report security-related issues, vulnerabilities, or sensitive information publicly. Instead, report sensitive bugs by email to [insert contact email].

To report a bug, follow these steps:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/GlobeHoppin/globe-hoppin-backend/issues/new).
- Describe the expected behavior versus the actual behavior.
- Provide detailed reproduction steps, including your code and context for good bug reports. Consider isolating the problem in a reduced test case.
- Include the information you gathered in the previous section.

Once your issue is filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will attempt to reproduce the issue based on your steps. If reproduction steps are missing, the team may ask you for clarification and mark the issue as `needs-repro`.
- If the issue is reproducible, it will be marked `needs-fix` and assigned for resolution.
