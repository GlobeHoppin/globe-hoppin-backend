  git add .
  git commit -m 'commit message'
  git push origin <branch-name> --force-with-lease
  ```

## How to Update Your Fork

To keep your fork updated with the original repository, you need to pull and merge updates from the upstream repository:

```bash
# Fetch upstream repository
git fetch upstream

# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes into your local main branch
git merge upstream/main
```

Or using a single command:

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull and merge upstream changes
git pull origin main
```
