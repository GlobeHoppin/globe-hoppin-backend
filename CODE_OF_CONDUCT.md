Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
